## Introduction / Why are there no releases?

This project serves as a demonstration of the [ESMF Schematics Project](https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk-js-schematics) in an Angular application.
Please be aware that this repository will not publish any releases. The purpose is to look at the current state of code and the documentation to understand by example how ESMF SDK-JS-Schematics works.

## About

The primary goal of this project is to illustrate the generation and interaction of different tables within an Angular application using ESMF Schematics. This complete solution demonstrates not just the ability to generate tables dynamically but also outlines how to interact with them effectively.

## How it Works
The ESMF Schematics project is leveraged here to generate a variety of tables in the Angular application. You can interact with these tables, exploring features such as sorting, filtering, and pagination. This demonstration highlights the practicality of ESMF Schematics in creating powerful, interactive elements in an Angular application.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk-js-schematics-demo.git
```

To launch the demo application and execute the e2e tests, please refer to the detailed guide available in the [Angular 14 DEMO App](/angular16-demo-app/README.md).
